PART 1: We produced different.txt files within the same directory as the ww.c file to test Part 1 of our code. We inserted lines after sentences, blank lines, tabs between words, and extra spaces between words to our text files to provide variations. We used a variety of these and modified the placement of our words in the text file. We tested the application for different column lengths while making different permutations of the text files. By checking the right character length on each line, we were able to determine the accuracy of our outputs and hand-checked it on a piece of paper.

Some examples of our test cases:

PART 2: We built different directories within the same directory of ww.c to test our code for Part 2. We began by just generating one directory that included only one.txt file after extending the code from Part 1. To add on, we tested if our application could disregard all other files that were not.txt files.
